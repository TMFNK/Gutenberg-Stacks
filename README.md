# Gutenberg Book Finder

A search & browse interface for free Project Gutenberg books. Search instantly across titles, authors, subjects, and summaries; filter by mood, theme, difficulty, subject, language, and era; or hit "Surprise me". Every book card shows its cover, an LLM-generated hook, and tags, with a detail view linking straight to the free book on gutenberg.org.

**Live site:** <https://tmfnk.github.io/Gutenberg-Book-Finder/>

Currently covering the 1,000 most-downloaded books on Project Gutenberg (M1). Scaling to the full catalog (~75,000 books) is planned.

## How it works

A Python pipeline builds the map data once, offline:

1. **Catalog** — fetch book metadata (title, author, subjects, download counts) from the [Gutendex](https://gutendex.com/) API.
2. **Excerpts** — download each book's plain text, strip the Project Gutenberg boilerplate, keep the first ~2,000 words.
3. **Embed** — embed title + subjects + excerpt locally with `sentence-transformers` (multilingual, runs on-device — no API cost).
4. **Layout** — project embeddings to 2D with UMAP, group into clusters with HDBSCAN.
5. **Enrich** — an LLM (via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)) names each cluster and tags every book with a mood, themes, difficulty, and one-line hook.
6. **Export** — write compact JSON consumed by the frontend.

The scraped metadata (catalog, LLM tags, exported book data) is committed to this repo, so the frontend runs without re-running the pipeline.

The frontend is a static site: Vite + TypeScript, no framework. Search is client-side via [MiniSearch](https://github.com/lucaong/minisearch). No server required; deploys to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`.

```

## Running the pipeline

```bash
cd pipeline
uv sync
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...   # required for the enrich stage
uv run python -m gutenberg_galaxy all       # runs every stage
uv run python -m gutenberg_galaxy catalog   # or run one stage at a time
uv run pytest                                # run tests
```

Each stage caches its output under `data/` and skips work already done, so the pipeline is safe to re-run or resume after an interruption.

## Running the frontend

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

Requires `web/public/data/books.json`, produced by the `export` pipeline stage (already committed to the repo).
